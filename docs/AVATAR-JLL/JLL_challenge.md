# Challenge of AVATAR Joint Learning Lab - VR & Robotics Lab 


This document presents the challenge for the AVATAR JLL, making reference to the general [workflow documentation](JLL_doc#2-workflow). 
The aim of the challange is to make practice with digital twin and VR technologies addressing a simplified problem that still makes sense from an industrial perspective while using real data.


The following trajectories are provided as [list of joint states](JLL_doc#241-robot-monitoring) defined in a JSON file:
- [trajectory_1.json](files/trajectory_1.json)
- [trajectory_2.json](files/trajectory_2.json)
- [trajectory_3.json](files/trajectory_3.json)
- [trajectory_4.json](files/trajectory_4.json)
- [trajectory_5.json](files/trajectory_5.json)
